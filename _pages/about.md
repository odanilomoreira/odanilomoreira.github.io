Hi, I'm Danilo, and since I was a teenager I love programming! Back in 2007, I graduated as a Data Processing Technician. After that, I graduated as a Lieutenant of the Brazilian's Army, and even there, I could find my way to change my main function to become in charge of the Information Technology sector. In 2016 I quit the Army and focused on developing my coding skills mainly in Python, REST APIs, and Data Science.

Soon I got a job as a Data Scientist, which helped me a lot. After concluding two big Data Science projects there, and finishing my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems, I decided to create my first online course at Udemy, teaching how to create REST APIs with Python and Flask. It has been a major success. In less than three months I reached more than 260 students, and I figured that teaching is great for mastering the skills. That's why I'm currently creating the second course, which will be covering all aspects of Data Science and Machine Learning: since Statistics, Math, Python, Pandas, Numpy and much more.

I believe that self-improvement is the key to great success in life, and be able to work abroad would be a dream coming true because I'm absolutely sure this experience will help me to grow very fast and contribute much more in return.
